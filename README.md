## Installation (development version)

    go get -u github.com/xyproto/guessica/cmd/guessica

## Usage

	guessica PKGBUILD

## Note

The `pkgver` and `source` arrays will be guessed by searching the project webpage as defined by the `url`. For for projects on GitHub, `github.com` may also be visited.

Updating a `PKGBUILD` may or may not work. `guessica` will be doing its best, by guessing. Take a backup of your `PKGBUILD` first, if you need to.
